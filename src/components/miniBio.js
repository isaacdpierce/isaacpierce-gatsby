    <h6>In a nutshell</h6>
    <p>
      I love my work! I spend 10-12 hours a day in "work mode". I get an
      obnoxious amount of joy from making something appear on a computer screen.
      The power to create useful and beautiful things is beyond rewarding. I've
      been making such things on the internet since 2008.

      <a href='#contact'>Work with me!</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I love coding and I care about creating the best possible programs
      I can. Because I love learning and sharing new skills. I govern a genuine
      desire to understand people and their needs. I'm passionate, punctual,
      patient and professional. And because being of service to others makes me
      the happiest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also harbour a robust sense of humour and a calm and courteous state of
      being (for the most part).
